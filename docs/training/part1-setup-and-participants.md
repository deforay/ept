[← Back to Curriculum](README.md) | [Next: Part 2 — PT Survey & Shipment Management →](part2-surveys-and-shipments.md)

**Audience:** Admin

**Objective:** Understand the admin interface and how to add and enroll participants.

---

## 1.1 Logging In & Dashboard Overview

- Navigate to the admin login page
- Log in with PT Administrator / PT Manager credentials
- Quick tour of the dashboard and left-side menu:
  - **Configure** — system settings, participants, enrollments
  - **Manage** — PT Surveys
  - **Analyze** — evaluation, reports, finalization
  - **Reports** — shipment and performance reports

## 1.2 Adding Participants

**Single participant:**
- Go to **Configure → PT Participants → Add**
- Fill in required fields (name, unique identifier, contact details)
- Save

**Bulk import (recommended for large groups):**
- Go to **Configure → PT Participants → Bulk Import Participants**
- Download the Excel template (link on the right side of the page)
- Fill in participant details — fields with red headings are required
- Password can be left blank (system will auto-generate) or set manually
- Upload the completed file

## 1.3 Scheme Enrollment

- Go to **Configure → Scheme Enrollments**
- Select the scheme type from the dropdown (e.g., HIV Serology)
- Click on the relevant scheme enrollment link
- Move participants from the **Available** list (left) to the **Enrolled** list (right)
- Click **Enroll Selected** to save

> **Key concept:** Participants must be enrolled in a scheme before they can be enrolled in individual shipments under that scheme.

## Trainer Notes
- Have participant data ready in the Excel template before the session
- Emphasize the difference between scheme enrollment (one-time setup) and shipment enrollment (per-survey)
- If the deployment uses Data Managers, briefly explain that each participant needs at least one Data Manager assigned (**Configure → Data Managers**)
