## About This Training

**What is ePT?** A web-based application used by PT Providers to manage the Proficiency Testing lifecycle — from creating surveys and enrolling participants, to evaluating results and generating reports.

**Who is this for?** Trainers and PT Managers who will manage the PT program or conduct step-down trainings. The Participant section (Part 3) can be delivered as a standalone module for participant-only step-down training.

**Duration:** 30–45 minutes total
