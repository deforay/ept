# Part 2: PT Survey & Shipment Management (~10 min)

[← Part 1: Setup & Participants](part1-setup-and-participants.md) | [Back to Curriculum](README.md) | [Next: Part 3 — Participant →](part3-participant.md)

**Audience:** Admin

**Objective:** Create a PT Survey, add shipments with sample data, enroll participants, and ship.

---

## 2.1 Create a PT Survey

- Go to **Manage → PT Survey**
- Click **Add New PT Survey**
- Enter a PT Survey Code (letters, numbers, and hyphens only)
- Select the PT Survey Date
- Click **Add**

## 2.2 Add a Shipment (Scheme)

- From the PT Survey list, click **Add Scheme** next to your new survey
- Select the scheme from the dropdown (e.g., Dried Tube Specimen - HIV Serology)
- Scroll down and configure:
  - **Shipment Code** — auto-generated, can be customized
  - **Result Due Date** — deadline for participant submissions
  - **Samples** — add 3–5 samples using the **+Sample/Control** button, and set expected results for each
- Click **Add Shipment**

## 2.3 Enroll Participants to the Shipment

- From the shipment list, click the **Enroll** button (red)
- Move participants from the Available list to the Enrolled list
- Click **Enroll** to save

> **Note:** Only participants who are already enrolled in the scheme (Part 1, Step 1.3) will appear in the available list.

## 2.4 Ship the PT Survey

- Go to **Manage → PT Survey**
- Find your survey in the table
- Click **Ship Now**
- Confirm when prompted

> **What happens when you ship?** The survey becomes visible to enrolled participants. They can now log in and submit results. No further structural changes should be made after shipping.

## Trainer Notes
- Demonstrate one complete cycle: create survey → add shipment → enroll → ship
- Highlight that a single PT Survey can contain multiple shipments (different schemes)
- Emphasize that shipping is the trigger — nothing is visible to participants until this step
