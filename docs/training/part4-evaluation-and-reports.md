## Trainer Notes
- Walk through the full evaluate → generate → finalize flow live
- Emphasize that evaluate and generate can be repeated, but finalize cannot be undone
- After finalizing, switch to a participant login to show that reports are now downloadable (ties back to [Part 3, Step 3.3](part3-participant.md#33-downloading-reports-after-finalization))
